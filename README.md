# Resume-Classification
THe objective of this project is to build a NLP model that would be capable of classfying Resumes based on their skillset
    A unique webapp that takes in resumes and classifies its domain based on the skillset.
    This can be a very handy tool for Human Resources Team or staffing agents. Different 
    organisations have different positions to be filled, and also they receive multiple 
    CVs every day. It can be tedious to manually separate them, and there where this tools 
    comes into picture. At first, skillsets are mapped to the specific job roles from the 
    training dataset, once the mapping is done, it can then classify any CV based on the 
    job roles. It accepts file in .doc, .docx and .pdf format.
